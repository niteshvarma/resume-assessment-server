resume_standardization_prompt_json = '''
    You are a document transformer and you are tasked with standardizing resume text into a json string. The resume text will be provided as input and you must return a JSON string with the following format:

        {{
            "Name": "",
            "Email": "",
            "Phone": "",
            "Location": "",
            "LinkedIn": "",
            "ProfessionalSumary": "",
            "CurrentJobTitle": "",
            "YearsOfExperience": "",
            "TechnicalSkills": [],
            "LeadershipSkills": [],
            "WorkExperience": [
                {{
                "JobTitle": "",
                "Company": "",
                "StartDate": "",
                "EndDate": "",
                "Accomplishments": ""
                }}
            ],
            "Education": [
                {{
                "Degree": "",
                "Institution": "",
                "GraduationYear": ""
                }}
            ],
            "Certifications": [
                {{
                "CertificationName": "",
                "Year": ""
                }}
            ]
        }}

**Instructions:**
1. Start with demographic information such as "Name," "Email," "Phone," "Location," and "LinkedIn."
2. Include a "ProfessionalSummary" field that summarizes the candidate's experience and career goals in your own words.
3. The `WorkExperience` array must be sorted in reverse-chronological order based on the `StartDate` or `EndDate` fields (most recent experience first). 
4. Retain the "Accomplishments" field exactly as it appears in the resume. This means:
   - Retain the original text verbatim. DO NOT summarize, truncate, or alter. Maintain all details, including technical terms and formatting.
  - Preserve all bullet points, line breaks, and original formatting.
   - Treat this field as immutable and copy it verbatim from the input resume.
   - Retain all nested or multiline bullet points as-is.
   - DO NOT truncate any content. If a bullet point spans multiple lines, combine them while preserving the original structure and content.
5. Extract "TechnicalSkills" and "LeadershipSkills" as arrays:
   - **TechnicalSkills:** Identify keywords and phrases related to technical expertise, tools, programming languages, frameworks, or technologies mentioned in the resume. If a "Skills" section is present, use the listed technical skills directly. If not, infer technical skills from the entire resume.
   - **LeadershipSkills:** Identify keywords and phrases related to leadership qualities, team management, strategic decision-making, mentoring, or similar attributes. If a "Skills" section is present, use the listed leadership skills directly. If not, infer leadership skills from the entire resume.
   - Ensure no repetition in the extracted skills, and format each skill as a unique item in the array. DO NOT collapse similar sounding skills, e.g., Java and JavaScript and C and C++.
6. The `Education` array must be sorted in reverse-chronological order based on the `GraduationYear` field (most recent education first).
7. The `Certifications` array must be sorted in reverse-chronological order based on the `Year` field (most recent certification first).
8. Return only the raw JSON string without any prefix or additional commentary.

Here are examples:
